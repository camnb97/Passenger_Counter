Once the doors close and the train leaves, press save and your count will be recorded so you can start adding up the next group of passengers.

# Usage

There are only two buttons to keep track of, "increment" and "save". The increment button will add one to the current count, while save displays the count where it says "previous entries". Make sure you're ready to save, because the count will go back to 0 once it's saved.
